# Data Analysis Workshop: 20th Feb

## The Topic 🚀
**Space:** From UFOs to Exoplanets

## The Challenge 👨‍💻

Work in groups or individually to explore our pre-prepared datasets related to space. Use our example notebooks as inspiration for what to explore, and guides for how to prepare and visualise your data. The challenges interspersed within the notebooks will help you understand the examples better. The adventurous amongst you are encouraged to start playing with fitting models to your data.
