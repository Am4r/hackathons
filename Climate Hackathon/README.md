# Hackathon 2: 17 Jan

## #ClimateOpenDataHack

# The Topic 🌍:

**Climate Change:** Drivers, Mitigation, & Impact

# The Challenge 👨‍💻:

Work in groups of up to 4 (or individually) to compete on one of the two challenges: 

1. **Data Story:** Create a compelling data story that communicates something about climate change that can be hard to explain, or not readily understood. (e.g. How does the food we eat affect the emissions?)
2. **Data Product:** Create a prototype of a product (e.g. model) that could be used in climate research, mitigation efforts, or general understanding. (e.g. a model that predicts wind energy outputs could make the industry run more efficiently and make it a more viable source of energy).
