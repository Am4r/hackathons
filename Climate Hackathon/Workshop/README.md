# Data Analysis Workshop: 21 Jan

# The Topic 🌍:

**Climate Change:** Drivers, Mitigation, & Impact

# The Challenge 👨‍💻:

Work in groups or individually to explore pre-prepared datasets related to climate change. Use our example notebooks as inspiration for what to explore, and guides for how to prepare and visualise your data. The adventurous amongst you are encouraged to start playing with fitting models to your data.

# The Agenda 👩‍🏫:

6:30: Arrive, get comfortable

6:45: Intro talk & welcome

7:15: Start reviewing data

9:00: Wrap up

# The Data 📈:

- Sources:
    - Eurostat: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database)
        - Good for aggregated data over time and by EU country. Covers a wide range of topics
        - Please note, many of these have ambigious coded variables. I've included the dictionaries for most of these in the "eurostat_dict" folder, but if you need more check out this site: http://dd.eionet.europa.eu/vocabularies
        
    - Copernicus: [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home)
        - Good for mapping global climate and general weather indicators (e.g. wind speed, pressure, temperature, etc.)
        
- Pre-cleaned data can be found in the "Datasets" folder of this repo, or at this wetransfer [link](https://we.tl/t-kST04j2kcm).

# The Example Notebooks 📔:
