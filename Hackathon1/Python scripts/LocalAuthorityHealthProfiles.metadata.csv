90366,Life expectancy at birth,Life expectancy at birth: the average number of years a person would expect to live based on contemporary mortality rates.,"The average number of years a person would expect to live based on contemporary mortality rates. For a particular area and time period, it is an estimate of the average number of years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the age-specific mortality rates for that area and time period throughout his or her life.
Figures are calculated from deaths from all causes and mid-year population estimates, based on data aggregated over a three year period.
Figures reflect mortality among those living in an area in each time period, rather than what will be experienced throughout life among those born in the area. The figures are not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area could actually expect to live, both because the mortality rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.","This indicator gives context to healthy life expectancy figures by providing information on the estimated length of life. The two indicators are extremely important summary measures of mortality and morbidity. They complement the supporting indicators by showing the overall trends in major population health measures, setting the context in which local authorities can assess the other indicators and identify the drivers of life expectancy and healthy life expectancy.",,"Office for National Statistics ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/healthstatelifeexpectanciesuk2014to2016 )

21001,Hospital stays for self-harm,Emergency Hospital Admissions for Intentional Self-Harm,"Emergency Hospital Admissions for Intentional Self-Harm, directly age standardised rate, all ages, Persons.","Purpose behind the inclusion of the indicator:
To monitor the incidence of intentional self-harm requiring emergency admission to hospital (approx. 99% of hospital admissions for intentional self-harm are emergencies). To monitor public health programmes aiming to reduce the risk of self-harm. To stimulate discussion and encourage local investigation, and to lead to improvement in data quality and quality of care. To help improve the provision of services.
Why is it being measured:
Mental health and well-being is an important aspect of public health. This indicator is a measure of intentional self-harm as it has not been possible to include a suitable indicator representing all aspects of mental health and well-being. Self-harm results in approximately 110,000 inpatient admissions to hospital each year in England, 99% are emergency admissions. Self-harm is an expression of personal distress and there are varied reasons for a person to harm themselves irrespective of the purpose of the act. There is a significant and persistent risk of future suicide following an episode of self harm.
What this indicator measures:
Self-harm events severe enough to warrant hospital admission. These hospital admissions are being used as a proxy of the prevalence of severe self-harm, these are only the tip of the iceberg in relation to the health and well-being burden of self-harm.
Public Health Importance:
In contrast to the trends in completed suicide, the incidence of self-harm has continued to rise in the UK over the past 20 years and, for young people at least, is said to be among the highest in Europe.[1] The recently released 'Preventing suicide in England: Two years on Second annual report on the cross-government outcomes strategy to save lives[2]' review of data published by the 'Multicentre study of self harm in England' show that rates of self-harm declined in both genders from 2003 until 2008 and then started rising in males until 2012. The decline in rates in females levelled off after 2008. This pattern is similar to that seen for national suicide rates over the same period. The Multicentre Study data showed a rise in self-harm in girls (but not boys) under the age of 16 years in 2010-12 compared to 2007-9. This rise was seen for both the number of self-harm episodes involving girls under 16 years (increased by 16%) as well as the number of girls under 16 years presenting with self-harm (increased by 10%), but was much smaller than the increase reported based on Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Data on self-harm trends using HES data may be somewhat misleading and the large rise they suggest probably reflects improved data collection. The report also highlighted that suicide risk is raised 49-fold in the year after self-harm, and the risk is higher with increasing age at initial self-harm.Self-harm is poorly understood in society and people who harm themselves are subject to stigma and hostility. Self-harm is defined as an intentional act of self-poisoning or self-injury irrespective of the type of motivation or degree of suicidal intent. However, following an episode of self-harm, there is a significant and persistent risk of suicide which varies markedly between genders and age groups. Self-harm is one of the top five causes of acute medical admission and those who self-harm have a 1 in 6 chance of repeat attendance at A&E within the year. One study of people presenting at Accident & Emergency (A&E) showed a subsequent suicide rate of 0.7% in the first year - 66 times the suicide rate in the general population. After 15 years, 4.8% of males and 1.8% of females had died by suicide.[3] Aside from the obvious danger of death, self-harm and suicide attempts can be seriously detrimental to an individual's long-term physical health, if they survive. Paracetamol poisoning is a major cause of acute liver failure. Self-cutting can result in permanent damage to tendons and nerves, not to mention scarring and other disfigurements. The NICE guidelines on self-harm note that people who have survived a medically serious suicide attempt are more likely to have poorer outcomes in terms of life expectancy. An additional NICE evidence update was issued in April 2013 focussing on longer-term management of self-harm.[5], [6] There is also evidence of an independent association between people's physical ill health and their self-harm but it is not clear whether this is associated with pain or personality factors.[1] Those at greater risk include:  Women - rates of deliberate self-injury are two to three times higher in women than men.[4] ,  Young people - Self-harming in young people is not uncommon (10-13% of 15-16-year-olds have self-harmed in their lifetime).[4] Older people who harm themselves are more likely to do so in an attempt to end their life.[1] ,  People who have or are recovering from drug and alcohol problems.[1] , Self-harm in prisons is associated with subsequent suicide in this setting, suggesting that prevention and treatment of self-harm is an essential component of suicide prevention in prisons.[2], People who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or gender reassigned.[4] ,  Socially deprived people living in urban areas.[1] ,  Women of South-Asian ethnicity.[1] ,  Individual elements including personality traits, family experiences, life events, exposure to trauma, cultural beliefs, social isolation and income.[1], Other factors such as education, housing and wider macro-socioeconomic trends such as unemployment rates may also contribute directly, or by influencing a person's susceptibility to mental health problems.[1].

The suicide prevention strategy has been largely successful and influential, achieving close to their target reduction. However in contrast to suicide, rates of self-harm continue to increase.[3] The government’s mental health strategy “No health without mental health: A cross-government mental health outcomes strategy for people of all ages”[4], published in February 2011, includes how we will know if progress is being made in key areas for action. The strategy drew links to the then proposed adult social care outcomes framework[5] ambition of “people are free from physical and emotional abuse, harassment, neglect and self-harm” and the importance of the public health outcomes framework[6] indicator of the rate of hospital admissions as a result of self-harm. This indicator is numbered 2.10 in Domain 2: Health improvement of the final Public Health Outcomes Framework. Domain 2 focuses on actions to help people make healthy choices and lead healthy lifestyles. Improvements in these indicators will, in the main, be led locally through health improvement programmes commissioned by local authorities. However, for some, the core role for the delivery of related services might lie with the NHS.[7] Whilst the final social care outcomes frame work for 2013/14 still features the outcome, of “People are free from physical and emotional abuse, harassment, neglect and self-harm”, hospital admissions for self-harm are not explicitly measured.[8] A further document produced by the Department of Health in 2015 'Preventing suicide in England: Two years on Second annual report on the cross-government outcomes strategy to save lives' provides a review of the current evidence around suicide and self harm.[9] This report touches on the impacts of social media.The Chief Medical Officers report also focused on mental health and featured a chapter on self harm.[10] A suicide prevention strategy was launched in September 2012 [11]. This strategy acknowledges the increased risk of suicide in those with a history of self-harm looking at effective local action including having an effective 24 hour response to mental health crises, useful resources and national action to support local approaches.[11] The third sector plays a vital role in policy and practice on self-harm and suicide prevention. Whilst treatment of self-harm should follow the national institute for health and clinical excellence (NICE) guidelines.[12] [13] [14] The economic cost of self-harm on a national level has not been calculated, although the direct cost to the National Health Service (NHS) has been estimated at £5.1 million per year from self-poisoning with tricyclic antidepressants alone.[12] The indirect economic costs of self-harming behaviour to an individual and their family are unknown but are likely to be substantial, especially in terms of days lost from work and other activities, including family responsibility.[3]Public Health England will be supporting Local Authorities in the creation of Suicide prevention strategies.[9] Public Health England has recognised the specific inequalities in self-harm and suicide affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans populations and the challenges in responding to this at local government level. As part of work to respond to this need they are developing a toolkit with the Royal College of Nursing for nurses and allied health professionals to develop their skills and knowledge around lesbian, gay and bisexual young people who are at risk of suicide and recognise the wider context of their mental health in relation to their sexual orientation and identity. This will be published in spring 2015.[9]References 1 Department of Health, National suicide prevention strategy for England (September 2002) accessed Department of Health, National suicide prevention strategy for England (September 2002) accessed March 2015 at http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4009474 2 Department of Health, Saving lives: Our Healthier Nation, (July 1999) accessed March 2015 at: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4118614 3 Royal College of Psychiatrists, Self-harm, suicide and risk: helping people who self-harm: Final Report of a Working Group, College Report CR158, (June 2010), accessed March 2015 at: http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/files/pdfversion/CR158.pdf 4 Department of Health, No Health Without Mental Health: A cross-government mental health outcomes strategy for people of all ages, (February 2011), accessed March 2015 at: http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_124058.pdf 5 Department of Health, A consultation on proposals - Transparency in outcomes: a framework for adult social care (November 2010), accessed March 2015 at: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Closedconsultations/DH_121509 6 Department of Health, PH Outcomes Healthy Lives, Healthy People: transparency in outcomes, proposals for a public health outcomes framework, (December 2010), accessed March 2015 at: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_122962 7 Department of Health, Healthy lives, healthy people: Improving outcomes and supporting transparency, (23rd January 2012), accessed March 2015 at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthy-lives-healthy-people-improving-outcomes-and-supporting-transparency 8 Department of Health, Transparency in outcomes: a framework for quality in adult social care: The 2013/14 Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (November 2012), accessed March 2015 at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-adult-social-care-outcomes-framework-2013-to-2014 9 Department of Health - Mental Health, Disability and Equality Division, Preventing suicide in England: Two years on Second annual report on the cross-government outcomes strategy to save lives, (Feb 2015) accessed March 2015 at: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/405407/Annual_Report_acc.pdf10 Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer 2013, Public mental health priorities: investing in the evidence (2013), accessed March 2015 at: www.gov.uk/government/publications/chief-medical-officer-cmo-annual-report-public-mental-health11 Department of Health, Preventing Suicide in England – A cross-government outcomes strategy to save lives (10 September 2012), accessed March 2015 at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/suicide-prevention-strategy-launched 12 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), Self-harm: The short-term physical and psychological management and secondary prevention of self-harm in primary and secondary care, (July 2004), accessed March 2015 at: http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG16 13 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), Longer-term care and treatment of self-harm, (Nov 2011), accessed March 2015 at: http://www.evidence.nhs.uk/topic/self-harm 14 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE),Self-harm: longer term management - Evidence Update April 2013, accessed March 2015 at: http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG133","Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), NHS Digital, for the respective financial year, England.

However, there may be a question regarding the quality of external cause coding and differences in admission thresholds. There may be variation between Trusts in the way hospital admissions are coded. There may be variation in data recording completeness. Information could potentially be missing in the admission episode record but added instead to a subsequent episode record. In addition, some transfers which are also coded as episode order 1 (epiorder 1) and emergency could lead to double counting. Hospital admissions are a very small proportion of incidents of self-harm. The identification and coding of intent may be subject to recording bias.There may be variation between Trusts in the way hospital admissions are coded for example the coding of whether an injury is intentional. Routine data do not allow for all of these aspects to be identified and removed from the indicator, however, this may be done through local audit. There could be differences in recording information. Often the focus is on the type of injury (overdose, laceration) and its treatment rather than the underlying cause which can create large variations in whether the episode is recorded as self-harm.In order to allow comparison of groups with different age structures it is common to present “age standardised” rates. These are calculated by summing the product of age specific rates for each age band in the group by the number in that age band in the standard population. The sum is then divided by the total number in all age bands in the standard population to obtain the age standardised rate. This improves the comparability of rates for different areas, or between different time periods, by taking into account differences in the age structure of the populations being compared. Any difference between groups in age standardised rates is then not due to difference in age structure since the same standard population was used to calculate all age standardised rates. The method does however assume that minor differences in age structure within age bands are unimportant and in general this is true.","Copyright © 2017, Re‐used with the permission of NHS Digital.

Hip fractures are almost as common and costly as strokes and the incidence is rising. In the UK, about 75000 hip fractures occur annually at an estimated health and social cost of about £2 billion a year. The incidence is projected to increase by 34% in 2020, with an associated increase in annual expenditure [1].
The average age of a person with hip fracture is about 83 years with about 73% of fractures occurring in women. There is a high prevalence of comorbidity in people with hip fracture [2]. The National Hip Fracture Database [2] reports that mortality from hip fracture is high - about one in ten people with a hip fracture die within 1 month and about one in three within 12 months.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has produced a quality standard that covers the management and secondary prevention of hip fracture in adults (18 years and older). The standard is designed to drive measurable improvements in the 3 dimensions of quality – patient safety, patient experience and clinical effectiveness for fragility fracture of the hip or fracture of the hip due to osteoporosis or osteopenia. [1]
Interventions for recently retired and active older people are likely to be different in provision and uptake for frailer older people. This indicator therefore has sub indicators for ages 65-79 and 80+ disaggregated into males and females in the Public Health Outcome Framework data tool ( http://www.phoutcomes.info/ ). Inclusion of this indicator in the Public Health Outcomes Framework will encourage prioritisation of such interventions.

This indicator is labelled as experimental statistics because of the variation in data quality: the indicator values primarily represent variation in completeness of staging information.","Cancer is a major cause of death, accounting for around a quarter of deaths in England. More than 1 in 3 people will develop cancer at some point in their life. In January 2011 the Government published Improving Outcomes – a Strategy for Cancer. This document sets out how the Government plans to improve cancer outcomes, including improving survival rates through tackling late diagnosis of cancer. Diagnosis at an early stage of the cancer’s development leads to dramatically improved survival chances. Specific public health interventions, such as screening programmes and information/education campaigns aim to improve rates of early diagnosis. An indicator on the proportion of cancers diagnosed at an early stage is therefore a useful proxy for assessing improvements in cancer survival rates.",,National Cancer Registry,Public Health England,,"Crude percentage: the number of new cancer cases (for the specified site, morphology and behaviour) diagnosed at stage 1 and 2 is divided by the total number of new cancer cases (for the specified site, morphology and behaviour) in the same area and multiplied by 100.

The proportion of local authorities achieving 70% staging coverage increased substantially after 2012, the first year of data collection for this indicator.","This indicator looks at the percentage of cancers that are early stage out of all cancers for the specified sites. Because of this, cancers where the stage is not recorded are included in the denominator, so a low proportion of cases with staging data will lead to the indicator showing a low proportion of cases diagnosed at stage 1 or 2. The PHOF indicator excludes data for areas where fewer than 70% of the cases had known staging information, as the data quality of these areas is not robust enough to produce a meaningful indicator. Improving data quality will result in better outcomes on this indicator: if more cases are staged, the proportion of early staged cancers will tend to increase. It is important to note that data completeness improved considerably between 2012 and 2015, but still varies. As a result the indicator values are partly determined by completeness of staging information and genuine differences in rates of early diagnosis can only be demonstrated in areas with very high rates of staging completeness. Variation within a region covered by one branch office of the National Cancer Registration Service is more likely to indicate genuine variation in service quality and casemix.

It is possible for an area to have 70% of the cancers included in the PHOF indicator staged, but not to have 70% of all cancers staged.The casemix of cancers diagnosed will impact on the proportion of early stage cancers. For example breast cancer is far more likely to be diagnosed at an early stage than lung cancer, so areas with a high proportion of breast cancer will have better outcomes on this indicator in comparison with areas with a high proportion of lung cancer. Including prostate cancer in the indicator may incentivise PSA testing.The definition of cancer stage is agreed internationally by professional bodies.

This will enable them to have a better idea of the scale of the challenge in terms of numbers and costs in developing diabetes identification and prevention programmes. It will also help them monitor the progress that they are making towards closing the gap (i.e. meeting previously unmet need) between observed prevalence (number of cases of diabetes recorded) and actual prevalence in identifying people at high risk or with hitherto undiagnosed diabetes.Diabetic complications (including cardiovascular, kidney, foot and eye diseases) result in considerable morbidity and have a detrimental impact on quality of life. Type 2 diabetes (approximately 90% of diagnosed cases) is partially preventable – it can be prevented or delayed by lifestyle changes (exercise, weight loss, health eating). Earlier detection of Type 2 diabetes followed by effective treatment reduces the risk of developing diabetic complications.NICE guidelines for diabetes include those for children and young people, pregnancy, type 1 diabetes,type 2 diabetes, prevention of type 2 diabetes. All aim to improve the prevention, identification and management of those people at risk of developing diabetes and those with the condition.  https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/diabetes-and-other-endocrinal--nutritional-and-metabolic-conditions/diabetes",,PHE,"Public Health England, Epidemiology and Surveillance team",PHE,Numerator divided by denominator multiplied by 100,,"The expected number of people with diabetes was calculated as a sum of age-sex-ethnicity specific expected numbers, each of which was calculated by applying estimated prevalence to the estimated local age-sex-ethnicity specific population.

It is also associated with cancers in other organs, including lip, mouth, throat, bladder, kidney, stomach, liver and cervix.
Smoking is a modifiable lifestyle risk factor; effective tobacco control measures can reduce the prevalence of smoking in the population.
The Government’s Tobacco Control Plan (Towards a Smokefree Generation: A Tobacco Control Plan for England, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/towards-a-smoke-free-generation-tobacco-control-plan-for-england ) published in July 2017 sets out the Government’s strategy to reduce smoking prevalence among adults and young people, and to reduce smoking during pregnancy.

The APS is a designated as a National Statistic and provides a consistent time series of data. Users should therefore replace their previously published historical IHS-based estimates with APS equivalents.
Some differences in survey coverage, imputation and weighting methodology may result in some discontinuity for certain 'core' variables compared to estimates previously provided as part of the IHS and as a result the IHS and APS should not be directly compared.ONS have drafted a note (available  \documents\IHS_V_APS_Note_on_differences.docx ) to explain the differences further.",,Annual Population Survey (APS),"Risk Factors Intelligence Team, Public Health England",Annual Population Survey,"The prevalence is calculated by dividing the weighted number of self-reported smokers aged 18+ by total number of respondents (with a valid smoking status) aged 18+, expressed as a percentage.",,"<p class=""PHEBodycopy"">Linearised-Jacknife method.In July 2018, working in collaboration with the Office for National Statistics (ONS), we have modified the confidence interval method used for the smoking prevalence estimates calculated from the Annual Population Survey (APS).

A new indicator was required as the source data for the superseded physical activity indicators has been discontinued. The data provider, Sport England, has replaced the Active People Survey with Active Lives. The new survey provides the same indicators but the methodology has changed, both in terms of questions and the mode of completion (telephone to online/postal version). Public Health England have updated the physical activity indicators with Active Lives data to support local monitoring of performance against the government Sport Strategy and Chief Medcal Officer (CMO) recommendations. To ensure we align with the CMO guidelines we are also publishing the estimates for those aged 19+ rather than the existing 16+ definition.(1).Physical inactivity is the 4th leading risk factor for global mortality accounting for 6% of deaths globally. People who have a physically active lifestyle have a 20-35% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and stroke compared to those who have a sedentary lifestyle. Regular physical activity is also associated with a reduced risk of diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and colon/breast cancer and with improved mental health. In older adults physical activity is associated with increased functional capacities. The estimated direct cost of physical inactivity to the NHS across the UK is over £0.9 billion per year.The CMO currently recommends that adults undertake a minimum of 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate physical activity per week,or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week or an equivalent combination of the two (MVPA), in bouts of 10 minutes or more. The overall amount of activity is more important than the type, intensity or frequency.(1).PHE has co-produced the ‘Everybody active, every day’ framework.(2) This is a national, evidence-based approach to support all sectors to embed physical activity into the fabric of daily life and make it an easy, cost-effective and ‘normal’ choice in every community in England.To make everybody active every day a reality we need to monitor progress and measure the impact at a population, organisational, programme and individual level. The key outcomes within the public health outcomes framework (PHOF) will be central, ie, the percentage of adults physically inactive (primary outcome, PHOF 2.13ii) and physically active (secondary, PHOF 2.13i). Evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to increase the population levels of physical activity is summarised by Kahn et al.(3) 1. Department of Health, 2011.

Therefore prevalence of excess weight (overweight including obese) calculated from self-reported data is likely to produce lower estimates than prevalence calculated from measured data.Differences between self-reported and measured height and weight vary in a systematic way, primarily as a function of age and sex. This systematic variation can be described by formulas which may be used to adjust self-reported height and weight measurements at an individual level to give likely actual height and weight.Active Lives self-reported height and weight have been adjusted at individual level using formulas estimated with Health Survey for England (HSE) data from 2012 to 2014. HSE collects data on both self-report and measured height and weight from the same individuals and this allows adjustment formulas to be estimated.

As well as it being an avoidable experience for the young woman, abortions represent an avoidable cost to the NHS. And while for some young women having a child when young can represent a positive turning point in their lives, for many more teenagers bringing up a child is extremely difficult and often results in poor outcomes for both the teenage parent and the child, in terms of the baby’s health, the mother’s emotional health and well-being and the likelihood of both the parent and child living in long-term poverty.
Research evidence, particularly from longitudinal studies, shows that teenage pregnancy is associated with poorer outcomes for both young parents and their children. Teenage mothers are less likely to finish their education, are more likely to bring up their child alone and in poverty and have a higher risk of poor mental health than older mothers. Infant mortality rates for babies born to teenage mothers are around 60% higher than for babies born to older mothers. The children of teenage mothers have an increased risk of living in poverty and poor quality housing and are more likely to have accidents and behavioural problems.
As well as being included in the Public Health Outcomes Framework, teenage pregnancy has also been included as a child poverty strategy indicator 2011-14, in the ""A New Approach to Child Poverty: Tackling the Causes of Disadvantage and Transforming Families' Lives"" document, published jointly between the Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Education, April 2011More background information and advice on tackling teenage pregnancy is provided in Public Health England's joint paper with the Local Government Association (LGA) published January 2016  https://www.local.gov.uk/good-progress-more-do-teenage-pregnancy-and-young-parents",It is an ambition in Department of Health's  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-framework-for-sexual-health-improvement-in-england  and an indicator in the  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthy-lives-healthy-people-improving-outcomes-and-supporting-transparency  to reduce the rate of under 18 conceptions.

On average, smokers have more complications during pregnancy and labour, including bleeding during pregnancy, placental abruption and premature rupture of membranes.
Encouraging pregnant women to stop smoking during pregnancy may also help them kick the habit for good, and thus provide health benefits for the mother and reduce exposure to secondhand smoke by the infant.
Smoking during pregnancy can cause serious pregnancy-related health problems. These include complications during labour and an increased risk of miscarriage, premature birth, stillbirth, low birth-weight and sudden unexpected death in infancy.

The inclusion of this indicator will ensure that the local tobacco control activity is appropriately focused on pregnant women, in order to try to achieve this national ambition.

The data are collected by acute trusts that provide maternity services and then sent to CCGs on a commissioner basis. CCG level data are then converted to LA level using birth weighting. If there are several LAs within one CCG they will all have the same prevalence, thereby masking any variation in prevalence which may exist within that CCG. Where local authorities cross CCG boundaries, the local authority estimate is a weighted average of the CCG indicator values. Where a local authority is within a single CCG's boundary, the local authority value presented is the value from the CCG.
There has been a change of method for reporting this information from April 2017, removing those whose smoking status is unknown from the calculation. Excluding women with unknown smoking status from the calculation will provide a more accurate representation of the true proportion of women smoking at time of delivery. In the previous definition, women with unknown smoking status were effectively categorised as non-smokers. However, a number of these would be smokers and this therefore served to deflate the indicator value. The overall impact of this change at England level is small, although the impact will be greater for those Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) who have a high proportion of unknowns. Work is already underway to encourage and support Trusts/CCGs to collect and record accurate information. IT issues are reported as the main reason for high levels of unknowns, which should be resolved as systems embed and improve.","Copyright © 2017, NHS Digital","This material is Crown Copyright but may be reproduced without formal permission or charge for personal or in-house use and should be acknowledged as '©Crown Copyright, source: Public Health England 2017'.",http://www.content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB24222,19,"From April 2013 responsibility for Women's Smoking Status at the time of delivery for commissioning these services moved from Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) to Clinical Commissioning Group (CCGs).

The numerator is the number of mothers initiating breast feeding and the denominator is the total number of maternities.,"This indicator was judged to be a valid and an important measure of public health and was therefore included in the public health outcomes framework. Inclusion of these indicators will encourage the continued prioritisation of breastfeeding support locally. Increases in breastfeeding are expected to reduce illness in young children, have health benefits for the infant and the mother and result in cost savings to the NHS through reduced hospital admission for the treatment of infection in infants ( http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/119/4/e837.long .)
Breast milk provides the ideal nutrition for infants in the first stages of life.
There is evidence that babies who are breast fed experience lower levels of gastro-intestinal and respiratory infection. Observational studies have shown that breastfeeding is associated with lower levels of child obesity.
Mothers who do not breastfeed have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers and may find it more difficult to return to their pre-pregnancy weight (World Cancer Research Fund; DH, cited in NICE Public health guidance PH11  https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph11/chapter/2-public-health-need-and-practice ).

There is concern about the rise of childhood obesity and the implications of such obesity persisting into adulthood. The risk of obesity in adulthood and risk of future obesity-related ill health are greater as children get older. Studies tracking child obesity into adulthood have found that the probability of overweight and obese children becoming overweight or obese adults increases with age1,2,3. The health consequences of childhood obesity include: increased blood lipids, glucose intolerance, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, increases in liver enzymes associated with fatty liver, exacerbation of conditions such as asthma and psychological problems such as social isolation, low self-esteem, teasing and bullying.

This is an overall measure of multiple deprivation experienced by people living in an area.","Deprivation covers a broad range of issues and refers to unmet needs caused by a lack of resources of all kinds, not just financial. The English Indices of Deprivation attempt to measure a broader concept of multiple deprivation, made up of several distinct dimensions, or domains, of deprivation.",,Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG),The indices have been contructed by Oxford Consultants for Social Inclusion (OCSI),https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015,"The English Indices of Deprivation 2015 are measures of multiple deprivation at the small area level. The model of multiple deprivation which underpins the indices of Deprivation 2010 is based on the idea of distinct domains of deprivation which can be recognised and measured separately. These domains are experienced by individuals living in an area. People may be counted in one or more of the domains, depending on the number and the types of deprivation that they experience. Each domain represents a specific form of deprivation experienced by people and each can be measured individually using a number of indicators. Seven distinct domains have been identified in the English Indices of Deprivation; Income Deprivation, Employment Deprivation, Health Deprivation and Disability, Education, Skills and Training Deprivation, Barriers to Housing and services, Living Environment Deprivation and Crime. Individual domains can be used in isolation as measures of each specific form of deprivation. They can also be combined, using appropriate weights, into a single overall Index of Multiple Deprivation which can be used to rank every small area in England according to the deprivation experienced by the people living there. Along with two supplementary indices, Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index and Income Index Affecting Older People Index, they form the English Indices of Deprivation. These statistics allow the most, and least, deprived areas of the country to be identified as well as providing information about the issues faced by people living in different parts of the country.Scores for geographies larger than LSOAs are population weighted averages of the LSOAs in that area.
Estimates for GP practices have been re-calculated in 2016 by building the population weighted average over the IMD scores of the LSOAs where the practice population lives with 2016 populations.

Smoking is a major risk factor for many diseases, such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart disease. It is also associated with cancers in other organs, including lip, mouth, throat, bladder, kidney, stomach, liver and cervix.
Smoking is a modifiable lifestyle risk factor; effective tobacco control measures can reduce the prevalence of smoking in the population.
The Government’s Tobacco Control Plan (Towards a Smokefree Generation: A Tobacco Control Plan for England,  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/towards-a-smoke-free-generation-tobacco-control-plan-for-england ) published in July 2017 sets out the Government’s strategy to reduce smoking prevalence among adults and young people, and to reduce smoking during pregnancy.
In 2013 several survey modules were removed from the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) to leave a dataset solely based upon the Annual Population Survey (APS). Therefore the ONS announced it would no longer produce the IHS. Instead the questions formerly regarded as the IHS core will continue to be asked in the APS.
The APS is a designated as a National Statistic and provides a consistent time series of data. Users should therefore replace their previously published historical IHS-based estimates with APS equivalents.
Some differences in survey coverage, imputation and weighting methodology may result in some discontinuity for certain 'core' variables compared to estimates previously provided as part of the IHS and as a result the IHS and APS should not be directly compared.ONS have drafted a note (available  \documents\IHS_V_APS_Note_on_differences.docx ) to explain the differences further.",,Annual Population Survey (APS),"Risk Factors Intelligence Team, Public Health England",Annual Population Survey (APS),"The prevalence is calculated by dividing the weighted number of self-reported smokers aged 18-64 years by total number of respondents (with a valid smoking status) aged 18-64 years in a subset of the routine and manual group, expressed as a percentage.",,"<p class=""phebodycopy"" style=""margin-bottom: 12.0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: black;"">Linearised-Jacknife method.

Therefore, they are not offered housing by the Council. The indicator becomes a proxy for those individuals who are homeless and (potentially) living out on the streets.

The high reported crime rates in city centres are partly due to the use of small resident population figures as the denominator of the crime rate. The 'transient population' that migrates into these areas on a daily basis, either for work or leisure, will not be reflected in the resident population figures. Rounded resident populations provided by ONS are used to generate rates.

It is thought that recording improvements are more likely to affect relatively less serious violent offences and explains the larger increase in the sub-category ""violence without injury"" compared with ""violence with injury"". ONS has also been informed there has generally been little change in the volume of “calls for service” related to violent crime in the year ending March 2015 compared with the previous year. This, along with the evidence from the CSEW, suggests the rise in recorded violence against the person is largely due to process improvements rather than a genuine rise in violent crime.",,,,29,"Crime data are produced at Community Safety Partnership (CSP) level.

Most excess winter deaths are due to circulatory and respiratory diseases, and the majority occur amongst the elderly population(1). Research carried out by the Eurowinter Group(2) and Curwen(3) found that mortality during winter increases more in England and Wales compared to other European countries with colder climates, suggesting that many more deaths could be preventable in England and Wales.The public health white paper, Healthy Lives, Healthy People: our strategy for public health in England (November 2010) set out a new vision for a public health system. The Public Health Outcomes Framework, published in January 2012, is part of a series of updates that set out what we would want to achieve in a new and reformed public health system. These outcomes underpin the overall vision “To improve and protect the nation’s health and to improve the health of the poorest, fastest”(4) Excess winter mortality is indicator 4.15 in Domain 4: Health care public health and preventing premature mortality of the Public Health Outcomes Framework(4). In addition the Department of Health “Cold Weather Plan” emphasised the effect of cold on health and healthcare services.

It is possible that a small number of deaths might not have been registered when the data were released and this could vary between areas. This indicator only includes deaths which are registered by the end of the calendar year 20xx+3.If any records had a date of death which was not a clear date, the record was ignored.The EWD Index will be partly dependent on the proportion of older people in the population as most excess winter deaths effect older people (there is no standardisation in this calculation by age or any other factor). EWD Index was calculated based on the ""ONS Method"" which defines the winter period as December to March, and the non-winter period as August to November of that same year and April to July of the following year. This winter period was selected as they are the months which over the last 50 years have displayed above average monthly mortality. However, if mortality starts to increase prior to this, for example in November, the number of deaths in the non-winter period will increase, which in turn will decrease the estimate of excess winter mortality.ONS use a specially generated extract of mortality data in September for deaths that were registered by this month, but which occurred up to the end of July. These figures are then adjusted using the provisional number of deaths from the previous year's extract, compared with the final number of deaths. Final data is rounded to the nearest 10 and provisional data to the nearest 100.This indicator draws data from the annual ONS mortality file and presents unrounded EWD compared to the ONS publications.",,"You may use or re-use this information (not including logos) free of charge in any format or medium, under the terms of the Open Government Licence.

For each local authority, life expectancy at birth is calculated for each local deprivation decile based on Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs). The slope index of inequality (SII) is then calculated based on these figures. The SII is a measure of the social gradient in life expectancy, i.e. how much life expectancy varies with deprivation. It takes account of health inequalities across the whole range of deprivation within each local authority and summarises this in a single number. This represents the range in years of life expectancy across the social gradient from most to least deprived, based on a statistical analysis of the relationship between life expectancy and deprivation across all deprivation deciles.
Life expectancy at birth is a measure of the average number of years a person would expect to live based on contemporary mortality rates. For a particular area and time period, it is an estimate of the average number of years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the age-specific mortality rates for that area and time period throughout his or her life.","This is a key high-level health inequalities outcome and is core to the aims of the Department of Health. It shows inequalities within local authorities, enabling a focus on the deprivation that exists everywhere at small area level. By highlighting area based inequalities, it sets the context within which local areas can assess the other indicators within the framework and set priorities, identifying the drivers of life expectancy, especially in areas where life expectancy is low.",,Figures calculated by Public Health England using mortality data and mid-year population estimates from the Office for National Statistics and Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015 (IMD 2015) scores from the Department for Communities and Local Government.,Public Health England Epidemiology and Surveillance Team,,"Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) within each local authority were ranked in order of deprivation using overall IMD 2015 scores. They were then divided into ten categories or 'deprivation deciles' with approximately equal numbers of LSOAs in each. LSOA-level mortality data and population estimates were aggregated to these deprivation deciles. Life expectancy at birth was then calculated for each of the ten deprivation deciles in each local authority, for males and females separately. The slope index of inequality (SII) is a measure of the social gradient in life expectancy, i.e. how much life expectancy varies with deprivation. It takes account of health inequalities across the whole range of deprivation within each local authority and summarises this in a single number. This represents the range in years of life expectancy across the social gradient from most to least deprived, based on a statistical analysis of the relationship between life expectancy and deprivation across all deprivation deciles. The SII is calculated using population-weighted linear regression. To allow for differences in population size between deprivation deciles, each is given a rank score based on the midpoint of its range in the cumulative distribution of the local authority population. The deciles are first ordered from most deprived to least deprived. If decile 1 then contains 12% of the population, its rank score 1 would be 12/2=6. If decile 2 includes 10% of the population, its rank score would be 12+(10/2)=17. The life expectancy for each decile is plotted against this rank score and a population-weighted regression line is fitted to the data by the least squares method. The SII is the gradient of the resulting fitted line. In some local authorities a meaningful life expectancy estimate cannot be calculated for every local deprivation decile because of very small populations or deaths, or large uncertainty in the life expectancy value. In these cases, the SII in life expectancy is not provided.
In May 2017, three changes were made to the methodology for the calculation of the SII for data for 2010-12 onwards.1. A revised methodology for the calculation of life expectancy was implemented, to use an upper age band of 90 and over, whereas previously the upper age band was set to 85 and over. The change was made to reflect an increasing proportion of deaths at ages 85 and over, and results in greater accuracy of life expectancy estimates. This change was implemented by ONS for their sub-national life expectancy estimates in November 2016, and further information can be found at: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/methodologies/methodchangestolifeandhealthstateexpectancies 2. IMD 2015 has been used to define deprivation deciles, replacing IMD 2010 which was previously used. Since IMD 2015 is constructed using data mostly from 2012/13, using it to group areas into deciles for the time periods that it most closely aligns with should produce a more accurate way of differentiating deprivation areas.3. A revised method of calculating confidence intervals was introduced (see section below)Due to these changes, previously published data for 2002-04 onwards, are not comparable with the current data and have been removed from the tool.
A guide to interpretation, data sources and method of calculation for the PHOF overarching indicators is available here: ../../../../../../../../../../../documents/PHOF_Overarching_user_guide_Feb_2018_updated%20FINAL.pdf",,"The confidence intervals for the SII are calculated by simulation. Simulation is a method used to estimate the degree of uncertainty for measures where the statistical distributions underpinning the measure are too complex to analyse mathematically. For each decile, the life expectancy (LE) has been calculated along with its standard error (SE). These SEs give information about the degree of uncertainty around each of the life expectancy values: essentially it describes a statistical distribution for each decile. Using a random number generating algorithm, a random value is taken from each decile LE distribution and the SII recalculated. This is repeated many times (1,000,000), to build up a distribution of SII values based on random sampling from the decile LE distributions. The 2.5% and 97.5% values from this distribution of SII values are then reported as the 95% confidence interval for the SII.Note that previously the confidence intervals were calculated based purely on the SII regression slope, ignoring the distributional information about the decile LEs. This method generally overestimated the width of the confidence intervals, ie it was overly conservative in most cases. The current method allows greater discrimination between areas and over time.",,,,,Disclosure control not required as number of deaths cannot be determined from life expectancy figures.,,Crown copyright 2018,"You may use and re-use Crown copyright information from this website (other than the Royal Arms and departmental or agency logos) free of charge in any format or medium, under the terms and conditions of the Open Government Licence, provided it is reproduced accurately and not used in a misleading context.
